Reboot of my 2007 server, writing a cleaner code.

### Pre-requisites:    
1. Openssl   
2. Python 3   
     
     
### Execution Requirements:    
Put in the need .dll files where the executable is and run it.    
The prerequisite binary packages has all that is needed.     



Unpack the HttpdWin.zip to C:\ drive and find some test pages and script that was used for validation.    
You need to create public key and private key files, use openssl commands to create them , it should be in PEM format.


As of now, Load tests haven't been done.    
There may be memory leaks. 

### NOTE: 
As of now it runs only from C:\ drive    
Does not use MinGW neither does it use MSys or WSL.
